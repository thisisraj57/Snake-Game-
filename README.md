Title: Snake Game

Description:

The Snake Game is a classic and engaging arcade-style game that challenges players to navigate a snake through a confined space, aiming to collect food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body and the game borders. Here's an overview of the game's features:

Visual Appeal:
The game features a visually appealing interface with a light blue background and vibrant colors for the snake and food. The snake is represented by a circular head, and the food is depicted as a square. The overall design enhances the player's gaming experience.

User Controls:
Players control the snake's movement using the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) on the keyboard. The snake can be directed to move in four directionsâ€”up, down, left, and right. The spacebar is used to stop the snake's movement temporarily.

Game Elements:

Snake: The main character of the game is a snake with a circular head. As the snake consumes food, it grows longer, increasing the challenge of navigating through the game space.
Food: The game includes food represented by a square. When the snake consumes the food, it earns points, and a new piece of food appears at a random location.
Scoreboard: A scoreboard at the top-left corner of the screen displays the player's current score and the highest score achieved in the session.
Sound Effects:
The game incorporates sound effects to enhance the gaming experience. A sound is played when the snake consumes food, providing auditory feedback to the player.

Dynamic Difficulty:
The difficulty level of the game dynamically increases as the player scores more points. The snake's speed gradually intensifies, adding an extra layer of challenge and excitement to the gameplay.

Interactive Messages:
Messages are displayed on the screen to inform players of significant events, such as achieving a new high score or colliding with the snake's own body. These messages contribute to the overall engagement and feedback loop of the game.

Continuous Gameplay:
The game operates on a continuous loop, allowing players to enjoy the challenging and addictive nature of the Snake Game. The snake's movement is updated at regular intervals, and the game continues until the player decides to exit.

Customization Options:
While the core gameplay remains true to the classic Snake Game, the code can be easily customized to adjust visual elements, sound effects, and other parameters to suit the preferences of individual players.

Overall, the Snake Game provides a timeless and entertaining experience, combining strategic thinking with quick reflexes as players strive to achieve the highest score possible.
